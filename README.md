<h3 align="center">Samikshsthal (समीक्षस्थल): The Ultimate Tourist Assistant and Wallet</h3>

<b>Abstract:</b><br>
<ul>
<li>Tourism is the biggest industry in the world. One of the major contributors to the Indian economy is the tourism department. Within these few years, there has been a severe decline in the tourism department. So, we developed a product that could contribute in the field of tourism. An App Samikshsthal (समीक्षस्थल): The Ultimate Tourist Assistant that will provide services like reviewing system, offline payment wallet, tell nearby places( within 400 m radius) and calculate taxi fare helping in attracting tourists and with a benefactor there could be an increase in this field.<br>
<b>How does it work?</b><br>
Whenever a tourist comes to visit a monument, they buy a ticket. We propose to add a QR code to the ticket so that whenever the ticket is bought, the tourist can scan the QR code and give a review. This will also automatically tell us about the location of the tourist.  Having their location and them being logged in our App and we can ask for their suggestions and reviews. 
Every user  has to complete 5 question to complete the review which will be general questions regarding:
<ol>
<li>Overall ambiance
<li>Cleanliness</li>
<li>Facilities</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
  <li>Staff behavior</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>
It also provides the functionality of Offline Payments which uses a real-time database of firebase as its database. So, whenever a user transfers his/her money to another person it gets added to its wallet even when he/she is offline and gets updated whenever anyone of them comes online. </li>
<br>
  <li>
It provides details of all the nearby places like hotels, bus stops, airports, ATMs, hospitals etc. and even can navigate to all the above-mentioned places. </li>
<br>
<li>App also provides the feature of calculating Auto-rickshaw fare for one destination to another.</li>
<br>
  </ul>
<ul>
<li><b>How does blockchain help?</b><br></li>
As the problem here we might face is the identity of a person. Blockchain will help us in providing the transfer of data anonymously on a decentralized database. With this, no one will be able to access or distort the data regarding the reviews and the person providing us with the review stays anonymous and secure. 
After the user submits the review, his review is broadcasted on our ethereum based blockchain. Then 5 random blocks are allocated this review so that it can be verified. After the verification is complete the user is provided with certain points which can be utilized at various government flagship stores to attain offers. Now his reviews are added to the blockchain and sent to the local authority for their perusal. We will have one blockchain per tourist place. However, if the user's review is not verified as a correct review by more than 50%  people then that review is discarded and no points are awarded. Also, we will create a new blockchain every day and destroy the one created the previous day after all important information is extracted from it.We are creating new blockchains every day so that we can keep the track of the reviews in a day-wise orderly fashion.<br>
The above implementation ensures a decentralized and tourist-friendly approach for getting correct reviews from the tourists and strengthening the participation of tourists in improving the tourism. <br><br>
<li><b> USE OF MACHINE LEARNING:</b></li>
The tourist can give us suggestions for optional feedback and with that, we will provide suggestions that could help in improving the facilities. With the number of tourists visiting, WebApp/App will predict the likelihood of the number of tourists by taking the number of reviews taken from the previous day using data analysis. Another prediction would be using sentiment analysis, whether the tourist will suggest anyone visit that place or not on the basis of feedback given by the tourist. The reviews given by the tourist will be prioritized accordingly and the problem with the larger number of submissions (eg. public toilets problem submitted by 80 people out of 100 people) will carry a higher priority and submitted to the institutional body with duty assigned in that position<br>Our major aim using machine learning would be to get the probability of people turning out for that place and how the improvement of facilities has increased or decreased the number of tourist coming to that location.
  </ul>

<ul><li><b>PROTOCOL:</b></li></ul>
<ol>
  
<li>Every single day, a report will be sent to the concerned officer of that area providing him with the lack of facilities in that area.</li>
<li>Every person giving review, if verified will be provided with credit.</li>
<li>The review provided by the tourists will be taken as whole into consideration and then analyzed which information is correct and which was wrong and the credit will be provided accordingly.</li>
</ol>
